# HomeAssistant-Atrea

Custom component - climate platform - for Atrea ventilation units for Home Assistant

## Installation using HACS

HACS is a community store for Home Assistant. You can install [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) and then install Atrea from the HACS store.

## Installation:

1. In your Home Assistant instance, create directory `/custom_components/atrea` in your `/config` directory.
2. Copy all files from [/custom_components/atrea](https://github.com/JurajNyiri/HomeAssistant-Atrea/tree/master/custom_components/atrea) of this repository to the newly created directory in your Home Assistant.

## Usage:

Add climate unit via Integrations (search for Atrea) in Home Assistant UI. You can also simply click the button below if you have MyHomeAssistant redirects set up.

Active warnings and alerts are exposed as button entities on the Atrea device.
Each button includes the condition's parameter code, severity, and translated
message. The button becomes unavailable when the condition clears. The filter
replacement warning can be acknowledged from its button. Alert buttons use the
unit's global alarm reset command, matching the original web UI. Other warning
buttons report that their condition cannot be acknowledged because the web UI
does not provide an acknowledgement action for them.

IN1 and IN2 are exposed as voltage sensors and SA1 as a percentage sensor. The
CO₂ sensor uses a configurable formula in the integration options. In the
formula, `x` is the IN1 voltage in volts and the result is ppm. The default
`round(x * 200)` preserves the previous conversion; leave the formula empty to
disable the CO₂ sensor.

The integration also exposes airflow requirements and measurements, and
heat-pump defrost state when their registers are available. Airflow values are
only meaningful in constant-flow operation; ODA airflow applies to supported
R5 units.

Outdoor, averaged outdoor, supply, extract, exhaust, and indoor air
temperatures are available as native sensors. D1–D4 inputs are exposed as
binary sensors.

Swing modes are enabled automatically when the unit's `H10511` register is
set to `1` (zone control). Their current state is read from `H10707`; `H10711`
is the last manually selected zone and may differ while a schedule is active.
The integration options allow overriding automatic detection and changing the
three displayed zone labels.
